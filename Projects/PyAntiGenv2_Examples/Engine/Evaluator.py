"""Parallel evaluation service for the proper joint NLL.

Every expensive diagnostic in this Engine -- the Wald Hessian, likelihood
slices, Sobol sampling, and profile likelihood -- is a large batch of
independent ``nll_func_fixed`` evaluations. This module turns that into one
primitive::

    with ParallelEvaluator(spec, n_workers=16) as ev:
        losses = ev.evaluate_batch([x1, x2, x3, ...])

and every consumer above it becomes embarrassingly parallel.

Design notes
------------

**Windows-first, not fork.** The previous parallel path forked, so it did
nothing on Windows. This uses a ``spawn`` context, which behaves identically on
Windows, Linux and macOS. Spawn cannot inherit memory, so each worker rebuilds
what it needs in an initializer -- which is the right shape anyway.

**Compile once per worker, not once per task.** Compiling the model costs
1.7-4.9 s while a single evaluation costs ~1 s, so a naive "one task = one
process" pool would spend all its time in ``te.loada``. Workers are persistent
and compile every needed RoadRunner exactly once at startup.

**cloudpickle for the spec, plain pickle for the tasks.** Replicate dicts hold
callables, and some ``loss_config`` entries are closures produced by factories
(e.g. ``figure5_loss_config_factory``), which ``pickle`` cannot serialize.
``cloudpickle`` can. We serialize the spec once, pass it to the initializer as
*bytes* (which pickle handles fine), and thereafter send only parameter vectors.
That keeps per-task IPC tiny.

**Failure is data.** A worker never raises across the boundary; it returns a
status and the failure sentinel, so one bad integration cannot abort a batch of
several hundred. Callers get a count of what failed rather than silence.

**No plotting in workers.** The progress overlay writes a fixed PNG/JSON path
from module-level mutable state; with N workers that becomes N processes
fighting over one file. Workers only ever compute.

Calling scripts must guard their entry point
--------------------------------------------

``spawn`` re-imports the ``__main__`` module inside every worker, so any script
that reaches this code must do its work under a guard::

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

``Model_run.py`` already does. An ad-hoc analysis script that calls
``setup_optimization_from_groups`` at module level will have each worker re-run
the whole analysis, and multiprocessing raises "an attempt has been made to start
a new process before the current process has finished its bootstrapping phase".
``evaluate_batch`` rewrites that message to name the actual cause; the caller
then falls back to serial rather than losing the run.

Note that even with the guard, module-level work in the main script (imports,
building EXPERIMENT registries) is repeated in every worker at startup, so
keeping that work light pays off directly in pool start-up time.

    The problem this solves: a profile point can want far more wall clock than

    easy -- raise out of the objective. Resuming is the hard half, because for
    Nelder-Mead the optimizer's entire state is its simplex, and an exception
    thrown through ``scipy.optimize.minimize`` takes that simplex with it. A
    resume from the best point alone re-derives the simplex from scratch and

    with parameter ``param_idx`` pinned at ``x_fixed``.

    A profile point is a whole optimization, not a single evaluation, so the
    scipy call runs *inside* the worker against its local models. That is what
    makes the profile parallel: 2k x n_grid independent optimizations in flight,
    instead of one adaptive walk stepping sequentially.

    **A point does not have to fit in one job.** On a four-hour queue a single
    nuisance minimization can easily want forty, so the point carries a
    ``deadline`` and stops itself when it arrives, reporting where it had got
    to. That is sound rather than merely convenient: every evaluation of this
    objective is an upper bound on the profile, so a half-finished point is a
    real point that happens to sit too high, and the store keeps the lowest
    value seen at each fixed value. Resuming can therefore only lower the
    curve, never raise it -- the same invariant the warm-continuation pass
    already relies on.

    Two things are carried across the interruption, and the second is what
    makes it worth doing:

    * ``nuisance_x`` -- the best nuisance vector reached so far, which becomes
      the next job's starting point.
    * ``nm_simplex`` -- for Nelder-Mead, the whole simplex. Without it a resume
      restarts the simplex from a single point and spends most of its next
      slice rebuilding what it already knew; measured on a 4-parameter
      quadratic, 30 further evaluations from the bare best point recovered
      almost nothing while the same 30 with the simplex restored made normal
      progress. The optimizer's state *is* the simplex, so saving it is the
      difference between resuming and starting over.

    ``job`` is a plain dict so it pickles cheaply. Returns a result dict that is
    written straight to the checkpoint file.

        ``frozen_sigmas``, stamped onto every job here rather than left to
        each caller's job-building code, is a ``{(block_key_or_exp_id,
        obs_label): sigma_used}`` lookup (see ``Engine.Optimize.
        block_sigmas``) pinning each data-floored block found in it at its own
        resolved sigma for the point's whole nuisance re-optimization, instead
        of letting it re-concentrate as the nuisance vector moves -- see
        ``Engine.Optimize._freeze_floor``. Every profile pass submitted
        through one ``batch()`` closure gets it uniformly this way, with no
        change needed at the individual job-building sites.

        Unlike ``evaluate_batch`` this uses submit/wait rather than map, because
        each job is minutes to hours long and results must be checkpointed *as
        they land* -- the whole point of checkpointing is that killing the run
        halfway keeps the half that finished.

        Points are admitted a poolful at a time rather than submitted all at
        once. Two things follow from that, and the second is the reason for it:

        * Only ``n_workers`` points are ever committed, so an eviction that
          arrives anyway destroys at most that many, not the whole batch.
        * A point is admitted against the clock as it is about to *start*, not
          when the batch was assembled. Submitting the whole list up front and
          checking the deadline there would clear a point that will not begin
          for another three hours, which is precisely the case the check exists
          to catch.

        When *budget* runs out the already-running points are waited for --
        they were admitted in good faith and are usually the expensive ones --
        and then :class:`~Engine.Deadline.DeadlineReached` is raised naming how
        many never started. Everything that landed has already been through
        *on_result*, so nothing computed is lost by the raise.

        A heartbeat is printed every ``heartbeat_s`` while nothing is landing.
        Waiting on completions alone means that with as many workers as points
        in flight, the run says nothing between the models compiling and the
        first result -- hours of silence that reads exactly like a hang.

        *on_result* is called with each result dict the moment it arrives.
        Returns results in completion order; callers key off the job fields.
