# Seventy years of pre-equilibration does not leave the compartments that hold
# no material at exactly zero. It leaves them at things like -2.4e-107, and on
# Lecanemab_10mgkg 94 of 269 species end the pre-dose block negative with 109
# of them below 1e-30. Nothing is wrong with that trajectory -- but when the
# dose then fires, those species acquire derivatives of order 1e+05 while
# sitting at 1e-107, so the integrator has to carry them up through roughly a
# hundred orders of magnitude. It does, by taking enormous numbers of tiny
# steps: the first 13.6 hours after the dose accounted for 98.5% of a 123 s
# block. Zeroing the dust first costs nothing and takes that block to 0.39 s,
# with no material change to any result.
#
# The threshold is deliberately far below anything physical. The real
# pre-dose value of these species is exactly zero, while genuinely small
# quantities elsewhere in the model reach 1e-15 (AB40_DensePlaqueNumber_BrainISF
# on the antibody-trial arms). A 1e-12 cut would delete those; 1e-25 cannot
# reach them and still removes dust that is eighty orders of magnitude smaller.

#
# At zero, CVODE refuses the call outright: CV_ILL_INPUT from cvInitialSetup,
# "Initial ewt has component(s) equal to zero (illegal)". That is a
# start-of-call check, so every r.simulate() is another chance to trip it, and
# the arms that trip it are the ones that integrate longest. Across the SILK
# arms the floor tracks follow-up length exactly -- 1.53e-178 at 20 years,
# 4.33e-230 at 27.8, 3.45e-270 at 35, and 2.07e-308 at 60, which is already
# subnormal. SILK_young_neg is named for when its labeling starts, not for how
# long it runs; it runs the longest and it is the one that fails.
#
# Re-setting the scalar does not repair the vector, and neither does
# setIntegrator; only reset() does, by restoring the initial state.
# setIndividualTolerance does, per species, and survives both simulate() and
# setIntegrator -- so the vector is floored here before each block instead.
#
# The value is bounded above by the smallest quantity that carries a result --
# 1e-15 in this model -- and below by the point where it stops reaching the
# tolerances that actually fail. 1e-21 is six orders below that smallest real
# quantity, so an absolute tolerance there still resolves it to six figures.
#
# This sits *above* _DUST_THRESHOLD, which an earlier value deliberately
# avoided. That constraint guards the wrong thing: everything below the dust
# threshold is zeroed by clamp_state_dust before the integrator sees it, so a
# floor above it cannot loosen anything that survives to be integrated.
# Requiring the floor to sit under the dust threshold pushed it down into a
# region where it no longer engages, which is how 1e-30 came to be a floor that
# almost never fires on the arms that need it.

# with. A retry loosens abs_tol to 1e-8 and rel_tol to 1e-10, so that run is

# At 1e-21 no arm retries or subdivides. Against the 1e-30 run the joint NLL

# subcutaneous depot after the drug has cleared; the largest quantity that
# shifts at all is 4.2e-04, by 0.12%. Nothing that carries a result moves.
# On silk_appfull nothing changes at any floor: no retries anywhere, and
# observables agree to eight or nine significant figures.
