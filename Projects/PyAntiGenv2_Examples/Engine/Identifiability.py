"""The slice screen: proving a parameter unbounded before profiling it.

A *slice* holds the nuisance parameters at their fitted values and varies one
parameter alone. A *profile* re-minimizes over the nuisance parameters at every
fixed value. The fitted nuisance vector is one feasible point of that
minimization, so for every value of every parameter

    dNLL_profile(x)  <=  dNLL_slice(x)

and the slice is an upper bound on the profile. That inequality is the whole of
this module. The codebase already relies on it elsewhere -- ``_profile_task``
keeps a half-finished point because "a half-finished point is a real point that
happens to sit too high" -- and here it is used in the one direction that turns
a cheap evaluation into a proof:

**If the slice far from the fitted value sits below the 1.9207 threshold, the
profile there does too, so the data do not exclude that value and this side of
the confidence interval is open.** One evaluation per side settles it, with no
nuisance optimization at all.

How far is "far", and why not the declared bound
------------------------------------------------
An earlier version of this screen read the verdict at the parameter's declared
bound. That is the wrong ruler. On this spec every bound is ``x0/10`` to
``x0*10`` -- a uniform one-decade search box around the starting value, written
to keep the optimizer in a sensible region, carrying no claim about physics. A
verdict read there says "the slice did not cross inside the box someone drew",
which halts the analysis on a convention when the crossing may sit just outside
it.

So the screen walks to whichever is *further*, the declared bound or
``span_decades`` from the fitted value, and states its reach in decades. Going
past a bound is safe in both directions and is the point of doing it. A bound is
a prior, not data: a slice that stays flat beyond it makes the finding stronger,
not weaker, and a slice that crosses just beyond it prevents exactly the false
halt an arbitrary box would have caused. The verdict then rests on a scale-free
statement -- "a thousandfold change in this parameter costs nothing" -- rather
than on where the box was drawn.

Where the bound still matters it is reported rather than assumed: a side whose
slice does not cross inside the declared bound but does cross outside it means
the fit's own search box is narrower than the confidence interval, which is
worth knowing and is not a reason to stop.

The screen is one-directional and must be read that way. It can prove a
parameter unbounded; it can never prove one identifiable. A slice that crosses
the threshold says nothing about whether the profile ever will -- the profile
may flatten out beyond the slice crossing and never reach it. So a pass here is
permission to spend profile evaluations, not an answer.

Why it is worth the evaluations
-------------------------------
An unbounded parameter is the most expensive object in the profile run. Every
one of ``max_extend`` extension steps fires on it, each a full nuisance
minimization at increasingly extreme values -- where the integrator is slowest
and ``safe_simulate``'s retry ladder is most likely to fire -- and the answer at
the end is still "open interval". At the measured cost of this spec the screen
is about ten minutes across the pool and the run it can avoid is days.

Why it halts rather than skipping
---------------------------------
A parameter the data cannot bound has to be fixed to a defensible value, from
the literature or to zero, and removed from the fit. That is a modelling
decision resting on evidence outside this run, and it is not one an automated
pass may take on its own or defer. So the screen raises
:class:`UnidentifiableParameters` and the analysis stops before spending any
profile compute. There is deliberately no override flag: an override is exactly
the on-the-fly decision this exists to prevent.

    crossing is expected. The slice crossing sits *inside* the profile crossing
    -- the slice is the steeper curve -- so a ladder placed for the profile
    brackets the slice comfortably.

    Half an SE rather than a whole one, because the innermost point is the one
    that certifies the inner bracket. A ladder starting at 1 SE puts its first
    point outside the slice crossing of any parameter tighter than the Hessian
    predicted, and then every evaluated point is above the threshold and

    :func:`screen_values`, unchanged -- is submitted one round at a time: round
    *r* asks the pool for every side's *r*-th candidate, all still-active
    sides together in one batch, which keeps this as parallel as the old
    single-batch version was. A side is retired the instant one of its points
    reads ``dnll > threshold`` and never contributes another evaluation --
    :func:`_verdict` reads a side's state from whichever point is furthest out
    among those actually evaluated, so nothing is lost by stopping there. A
    side that never crosses keeps going, round after round, all the way to its
    candidate list's last point -- the declared bound or ``span_decades`` out,
    whichever is further, see :func:`screen_target` -- exactly as before,
    because that is the one thing this screen has to be able to prove.

    Why stopping matters now and did not always: once a block's sigma is
    capped at a data-derived floor (``sigma_floor_from_data``), a point far
    outside the fitted region can return a genuinely enormous NLL rather than
    a merely large one -- the self-forgiving log(sigma) term that used to
    compress a bad far-out fit is exactly what the floor removes -- and that
    region is also where the integrator is slowest. A declared bound is a
    user-supplied number with no guaranteed relationship to anything physical,
    so nothing about it -- not "it is inside the box", not "it is only one
    point" -- is safe to evaluate unconditionally. The only bound that is safe
    is not asking for a point once its side has already answered the question.

    The one thing round-by-round stopping gives up: a slice that crosses early
    and then dips back below threshold at a point it never reaches would have
    been read as "open" by a full evaluation, and reads "crossed" here
    instead. That trades a slower profile on a rare, specific slice shape for
    never paying an unbounded evaluation on the common one.
