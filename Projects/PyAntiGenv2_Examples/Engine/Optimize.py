# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# One objective serves both the fit and every diagnostic. For a block of n
# residuals with unknown sigma, the Gaussian NLL is
#
#     n*log(sigma) + SSE/(2 sigma^2) + (n/2) log(2 pi)
#
# which is minimized at the ML variance sigma^2 = SSE/n. Substituting that back
# eliminates sigma analytically and leaves
#
#     NLL = (n/2) * log(SSE/n)  +  (n/2) * (1 + log(2 pi))
#
# The second term depends only on n, so it cancels from every dNLL and shifts
# no minimum -- but it is a real part of the likelihood, so AIC/BIC and any
# cross-model comparison must add it back (``include_constant=True``).
#
# Why this is the right objective here:
#   * No chicken-and-egg. Older code fitted a weighted chi-square, estimated
#     sigma from the residuals at that optimum, then profiled a *different*
#     function -- so the reported optimum was not the minimizer of the curve
#     being profiled, and dNLL went negative.
#   * The log makes each block scale-free, which is the principled version of
#     "weight the experiments equally": a block measured in different units or
#     with a wider dynamic range can no longer dominate.
#   * dNLL is a genuine likelihood ratio, so the chi2(1)/2 = 1.9207 threshold
#     applies directly.
#
# Note the n_e/2 factor still means a 50-point block counts ten times a 5-point
# block. That is correct under a likelihood. Wanting them equal regardless of
# point count is a claim about correlated residuals within a block, and belongs
# in a correlated noise model -- not in a 1/n divide on a log-likelihood.

# Guards log(0) when a block fits exactly. Squared-residual units.

    down from :meth:`ParallelEvaluator.profile_batch`, so a floored block's
    sigma sits still for the whole nuisance re-optimization instead of being
    re-estimated at every point the profile visits -- that re-estimation is
    the self-forgiveness the floor exists to stop when it pushes sigma_hat
    *above* the floor, and is worth stopping just as much below it, where the
    floor itself has nothing to say.

    *frozen_value* is the block's own ``sigma_used`` at the fitted optimum
    (``min(sigma_hat_opt, floor)``; see :func:`block_sigmas`), not the raw
    floor constant. That matters: most floored blocks are *not* binding at a
    good optimum (``sigma_hat_opt`` already sits below the floor, which is
    exactly why the fit was allowed to reach it), and pinning those at the
    floor anyway would inflate every such block's term for the whole profile,
    not just far from the optimum where self-forgiveness is the actual risk --
    flattening the profile's true local sensitivity and reporting a large,
    spurious dNLL even a fraction of a Wald SE from the fitted value. Pinning
    at the block's own resolved value instead reproduces the concentrated
    likelihood exactly at the optimum (the anchor and the profile then agree
    there by construction) and only departs from it exactly where the block's
    fit genuinely degrades as the profiled parameter moves.

    The main fit and every other diagnostic (Wald, slice, Sobol) pass
    ``frozen_value=None`` and keep floored blocks profiled as before; only the
    profile passes supply one. A block with no floor (``sigma_floor is
    None``) is untouched either way, and a block with a true declared sigma
    (``known_sigma`` already set) is never overridden.

    A block contributes ``(n/2) log(SSE/n)`` to the concentrated NLL, where n is
    the sum of the per-point weights. Multiplying every weight by c leaves
    ``SSE/n`` untouched -- the mean squared residual, and so the estimated
    sigma, are unchanged -- and turns the multiplier into ``c*n/2``. So c is
    exactly a claim about how many INDEPENDENT observations the block carries,
    which is a coherent likelihood statement rather than an ad-hoc reweighting.

    ``n_eff_scale`` is read off a loss element:

      absent or 1.0   n independent points. The default, and the right answer
                      unless there is a reason.
      float c         c*n independent points. c < 1 says the residuals inside
                      this block are correlated, so it carries less information
                      than its point count suggests.
      "equalize"      the block counts as ONE observation whatever its n. This
                      is literally "divide this element's loss by its number of
                      data points": the multiplier becomes 1/2 for every block,
                      so a 60-point arm and a 6-point arm weigh the same.

    Read the caveat in the concentrated-likelihood note above before using
    "equalize". Under a likelihood more data SHOULD count for more, and once
    blocks no longer carry their own n the total is not a log-likelihood: dNLL
    can no longer be compared with 1.9207 and AIC/BIC lose their meaning. It is
    a legitimate thing to want when arms are not exchangeable -- a dense 60
    point time course and one steady-state number are not 60 versus 1 units of

    (the unconstrained NLL is monotonically decreasing in sigma up to
    sigma_hat, so capping below it puts the constrained optimum exactly at the

      chasing whichever condition contributed the most replicates, and the
      element/group weights express the author's judgement about relative

    * **The joint log-likelihood** (``use_weights=False`` and

      of per-observable NLL terms. Averaging divides every dNLL by the number of
      loss elements, and weights scale it arbitrarily, so a dNLL built from the
      objective cannot be compared with the chi-square threshold of 1.9207 --
      the confidence intervals come out too wide by roughly the square root of
      that factor, and AIC/BIC and the Wald standard errors are shifted with them.

    For a **linear** coordinate the step is *relative*, not absolute. The
    obvious rule -- ``eps * max(|p|, 1.0)``, which compute_hessian_manual uses
    -- degenerates into a fixed 1e-5 step for every parameter below 1.0. PBPK
    rate constants routinely sit at 1e-8 or smaller (AGGREGATION_BOUNDS reaches
    1e-12), so that step is many orders of magnitude larger than the parameter:
    it pushes the value negative, trips the ``p <= 0`` guard, and the stencil
    comes back as a wall of 1e10 sentinels.

    For a **log10** coordinate the step is *absolute*, in decades, and a
    relative rule is actively wrong. In log space the coordinate is log10(p),
    so ``epsilon * |log10(p)|`` scales the step by the parameter's distance
    from 1.0, which means nothing: on silk_appfull it spread the steps 55-fold
    and handed the smallest one to IDE_Kcat_ISF_base purely because its value
    happens to sit near 1. A parameter at exactly 1.0 would get a step of zero.
    Log space exists to make coordinates comparable; the step should be too.

    ``log_step`` is also much larger than epsilon on purpose. The classic
    "h ~ macheps^(1/4)" balance behind epsilon=1e-4 assumes the only noise is
    machine epsilon. A central second difference divides by h^2, so an
    objective with numerical noise sigma carries an error of about 4*sigma/h^2
    into every Hessian diagonal -- and an adaptive ODE solve is noisy at around
    1e-5 nats, not 1e-16. At h=3e-4 that is an error near 450 against curvatures
    of order 100: the Hessian becomes noise, the matrix stops being positive
    definite, and sqrt(diag(inv(H))) returns NaN.

    ----------
    nll_func : callable(array) -> float
        Proper joint NLL, i.e. ``nll_func_fixed`` with sigmas frozen at the

        SEs in the wrong units.
    x : array
        Parameter vector at the optimum, in whatever space *nll_func* expects.
    bounds : sequence of (lo, hi) or None
        Used only to clip the reported CIs; a clipped bound is reported so the
        caller can tell a genuinely tight interval from a truncated one.
    loss_scale : float
        Divides the Fisher information.  Leave at 1.0 when *nll_func* is a true
        NLL; set it when the objective is a known multiple of the NLL.
    alpha : float
        1 - confidence level.  0.05 gives the 95% interval.

    Returns
    -------
    (cov, se, ci)
        ``cov`` is the (k, k) covariance matrix or None; ``se`` is a length-k
        array (entries may be NaN) or None; ``ci`` is always a length-k list of

    parameter, multiplicatively or not, while bounds are meant to carry
    physics. Reading the scale off bounds alone means dropping a physical limit
    silently reverts the fit to linear, which is the outcome this prevents.

    Fitting a multiplicative parameter linearly is what makes a single absolute
    ``xatol`` incomparable across a vector whose magnitudes differ by decades,
    and what drives the Hessian's dynamic range past what float64 can invert --
    which is why every Wald SE on the larger specs here comes back None.

    Anything that can reach zero or go negative stays linear: log10 has no
    meaning there, and _to_opt_space would raise.

    WHAT CHANGED 2026-09-09, and why. This used to return log10 only when
    ``2*search_decades >= min_decades``, i.e. only for a radius of at least
    half a decade. That tied two unrelated decisions together: how wide to
    scatter multi-start points, and whether the parameter is multiplicative.
    Wanting a tighter scatter is an ordinary thing to want, and at
    search_decades below 0.5 it silently switched EVERY parameter to linear --
    the one outcome the docstring above says this function exists to prevent,
    triggered by a field whose name says nothing about scaling.

    A radius expressed in DECADES is already a declaration that the author
    thinks multiplicatively; how many decades is a separate question about
    search width. So any positive, finite ``search_decades`` now means log10,
    and ``min_decades`` governs only the bounds fallback, where a span is
    genuinely evidence about the parameter's nature.

    runs out of ``max_extend`` steps before reaching dNLL 1.9207 reports no
    confidence bound at all. Ten of the sixteen sides in the last SILK/APP run
    ended that way, several of them with dNLL still below 0.01, which doubling
    would have needed a dozen more steps to lift.

    Instead, fit the curve that is already there and step to where it says the
    threshold is. Locally dNLL grows as a power of the distance, dNLL = c * d^p,
    with p = 2 wherever the quadratic approximation holds. Two points give both

    Estimating p rather than assuming 2 is what makes this work on the sides

    doubling stalls worst -- has p < 2 and gets a correspondingly longer step.

    Clamped at both ends. The lower clamp keeps a step from collapsing to
    nothing when the fit is poor; the upper one keeps a near-zero dNLL, which is
    as likely to be optimizer noise as signal, from launching a step of 10^6.
    Overshooting the threshold slightly is deliberate: the point of the step is

    The grid points of pass 1, and the first step of every continuation chain,
    start at the MLE with nothing to carry. Left alone scipy sizes each vertex
    at 5% of that coordinate's own value, which on log10-fitted parameters is
    not a step in the problem at all -- it is a step in the arbitrary offset of
    the log scale. Two parameters of identical physical uncertainty get vertex
    offsets differing by a factor of a thousand purely because one optimum is
    near 1e5 and the other near 1e0.

    The Wald standard error is the right scale instead: it is what the
    likelihood itself says the coordinate's uncertainty is, it is already in opt
    space, and the profile grid is placed from it too, so the simplex and the
    grid end up measured in the same units. Where the Hessian gave no SE for a
    coordinate -- singular in that direction -- *fallback* is used, a fixed step
    in opt space, which for a log10 parameter is a fixed factor.

    Measured on the 15-parameter ill-conditioned quadratic, mean excess over the
    exact profile for cold points, at equal evaluation cost:

        scipy default             4.1963
        diagonal, 1 x Wald SE     0.0024
        diagonal, 2 x Wald SE     0.0004
        uniform 0.05 (no SE)      0.1047
        uniform 0.20 (no SE)      0.0040

    The gain is four orders of magnitude and it is free: the evaluation counts
    differ by under 3%. It is also why the accuracy of a cold point is not a
    budget problem, which is what the old ``maxfev`` comment assumed -- a
    simplex that starts a thousand times too wide does not converge no matter
    how long it runs.

    CHOOSING *mult*. The sweep above walks a single chain with no budget limit,
    where anything from 1 to 8 measures the same. Run end to end against a cap,
    which is the regime a real profile is in, the picture separates. Three seeds
    of the 15-parameter problem at maxfev 400:

        mult    mean error   mean worst-case   worst seen
        0.5       -0.138%        -0.801%         -1.064%
        1.0       -0.136%        -0.736%         -1.034%
        2.0       -0.181%        -0.975%         -1.590%
        4.0       -0.193%        -0.878%         -1.005%

    So 1.0, not the 2.0 this started at. The margin is modest and it vanishes
    at the production budget, where every value reaches -0.00% -- this is
    insurance for a run whose budget is cut, not a headline gain. The direction
    is what matters and it is consistent: too wide costs more than too narrow
    here, because a vertex placed at twice the *marginal* SE is at dNLL 50 to
    126 rather than the 2 that an axis step is meant to cost. The marginal SE
    overstates how far one coordinate can move alone by the variance inflation
    factor, 2.5 to 7.9 across these coordinates.

    Using the conditional standard deviation instead, 1/sqrt(diag(H)), is the
    principled version of that correction and was measured: it is neutral to
    slightly worse at every budget, so it is not worth the plumbing. Narrowing
    the multiplier captures the same effect.

    """A starting simplex for a warm point, built from its neighbour's.

    Carrying the *point* forward and letting scipy build the simplex is what
    made warm starts underperform. scipy offsets each vertex by 5% of that
    coordinate's own value, and these parameters are fitted in log10, so the
    offset is set by where the log scale happens to put zero rather than by
    anything about the problem: a parameter at log10 = 5.43 gets a vertex 0.27
    away, a factor of 1.9 in the linear parameter, while one at log10 = 0.01
    gets 0.0005. In fifteen dimensions the optimizer then spends its whole
    budget contracting that back down and never reaches its tolerance, which is
    what the last SILK/APP run showed: 118 points, every one of them stopped by
    the evaluation cap rather than by convergence.

    So the neighbour's simplex is reused -- but only after two corrections,
    because reusing it as it stands is *worse* than letting scipy guess.

    SCALE is replaced, not inherited. A converged simplex is the size of the
    convergence tolerance, which is far smaller than the distance to the next
    point's minimum: measured on the Aducanumab chains the converged diameter
    sits near 1e-4 while the step to the next minimum runs from 1e-5 to 9e-2.
    It is therefore rescaled to ``scale`` times *travel*, the distance the seed
    point itself moved, which is the best available estimate of how far the next
    one must move. This is where the accuracy comes from, and it is insensitive
    to the multiplier: 1.5, 2 and 3 measure the same.

    SHAPE is inherited, but only after its conditioning is repaired. A converged
    Nelder-Mead simplex in a correlated valley is a needle. Measured on the
    engine's own 14-nuisance quadratic, its singular values span
    1.1e-2 down to 4.2e-8 -- a condition number of 2.7e5, with several axes
    collapsed to nothing. Restarted on that shape the optimizer cannot search
    the collapsed directions at all, so it converges quickly and reports a
    nuisance minimum that is far too high. That is not a small effect: carried
    raw, the mean excess over the exact profile was 21x *worse* than not
    carrying the simplex at all, while spending 57% fewer evaluations to get
    there. Flooring the singular values at ``cond_floor`` of the largest
    restores searchability in those directions while keeping the orientation
    that makes the rest of the step cheap.

    Note this is a high-dimension failure. At the two nuisance dimensions of the
    Aducanumab fit the same converged simplexes have a median condition number
    of 3.3, which is why the resume path has carried simplexes for that long
    without anyone seeing this.

    Measured over three seeds of the 15-parameter ill-conditioned quadratic,
    against the analytic profile:

        strategy                       excess NLL   evaluations

        rescaled, cond_floor 0.10        0.0197        205k

    Accuracy is flat for a floor anywhere from 0.30 to 0.08 and degrades below
    0.04, so the default sits mid-band with an order of magnitude of margin
    above the cliff at zero.

         can move the crossing outside the bracket pass 3 found, and can even
         drop a side back below the threshold it had reached.

    Pass 2 is what makes the run answer its own question. Passes 1 and 3 place
    points from the Wald SE, or from ``range_factor`` when the Hessian gave no
    SE, and neither is a prediction of where dNLL reaches the threshold. When
    that opening guess falls short, refinement cannot help -- it interpolates
    inside a bracket and there is no bracket -- so before pass 2 existed a side
    that ended below 1.9207 simply stayed there, and the run reported an open
    interval that a handful of further evaluations would have closed. The
    fallback was worst exactly where it was needed most: no Wald SE means the
    Hessian was singular in that direction, which is the least likely direction
    to be pinned down inside a factor of two.

    Passes 1 and 3 are wide and cold: every point starts its nuisance
    minimization at the MLE, so all ``2k * n_grid`` of them are independent and
    go out at once. That buys width at a real cost in accuracy. The nuisance
    minimum at a fixed value ``v`` sits at the end of a curved path through the
    nuisance space, and a cold optimizer has to travel that whole path from a
    standing start before it can refine; in a correlated likelihood it stalls
    partway and reports a value that is too *high*. Too high is the damaging
    direction: an inflated dNLL makes the curve appear to reach the threshold
    sooner than it does, so every interval comes out too narrow.

    Pass 3 fixes that by continuation. Points are ordered outward from the
    optimum and each one starts from its inner neighbour's solution, so the
    optimizer travels only the increment along the path rather than the whole of
    it. On a 15-parameter ill-conditioned quadratic this moves the mean CI error
    from about -34% to about -6% at essentially the same number of function
    evaluations -- accuracy that no affordable increase in the cold-start budget
    reaches, because the problem is where the search begins, not how long it
    runs.

    The dependency in pass 4 runs only *along* a chain (one parameter, one
    direction); the ``2k`` chains are mutually independent. So the chains are
    advanced in lockstep -- batch *j* holds the *j*-th step of every chain --
    which keeps each batch ``2k`` wide and needs no change to the worker or the
    pool.

    Returns ``({param_name: (param_vals_linear, dnll)}, anchor, where,
    diagnostics)``; the traces match the sequential walkers so plotting and CI
    extraction are unchanged.

    neighbour. Same budget, a fraction of the distance.

    Each step inherits its neighbour's simplex as well as its solution. Without
    that the start point is warm but the search around it is not: scipy rebuilds
    an axis-aligned simplex scaled to 5% of each coordinate's value, which
    discards the valley orientation the neighbour had just finished learning and
    is, on these log10-fitted parameters, one to three orders of magnitude wider
    than the step being taken. See _warm_simplex.

    Safe by construction: both the cold and the warm evaluation are evaluations
    of the same function at the same fixed value, so both are upper bounds on
    the true profile and keeping the lower one can only lower the curve. A lower
    curve can only push the threshold crossing outward, so an interval can widen

    answer worse -- if it changes nothing, the cold starts were good enough.

    Optimize shared parameters using ``experiment.opt_groups`` or ``optimization_spec``.

    fit_mode : "optimize" (default) runs the optimizer; "evaluate_x0" skips the
        fit and evaluates the starting point, so diagnostics can be run against
        stored parameters.  Supersedes the deprecated ``profile_without_opt``.
    reuse_fit : under fit_mode="optimize", look for a finished fit of exactly
        this problem in results/<MODEL>/fits/ and take its optimum instead of
        refitting, so a relaunch (a requeue on a preemptible partition) reaches
        the profile in minutes and anchors it on the same optimum as before.
        A fit that was killed part-way resumes from its best point. False
        always fits afresh. See Engine.Fit_cache.
    n_workers : processes used for the diagnostics (Wald / slice / Sobol).
        None uses all cores but one; 1 forces serial evaluation.  The fit itself
        is serial regardless -- Nelder-Mead is inherently sequential.
    profile_checkpoint : write each completed profile point to
        results/<MODEL>/profiles/<run_id>/<param>.jsonl so a killed run resumes
        instead of restarting.  Set False to disable.
    preequil_cache : reuse the leading untracked pre-dose block across
        evaluations instead of re-integrating it every time.  Enabled only when
        an invariance check confirms the fitted parameters cannot act before the
        first dose, so setting this True is a request, not an assertion.
