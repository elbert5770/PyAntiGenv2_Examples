"""The fast profile: one capped profile point per side, at the slice crossing.

A full profile finds where dNLL crosses 1.9207 for every parameter, and on a
QSP model that is days. Most of that time is spent on the parameters that
turn out to be poorly determined, and for those the answer is already visible
much closer in. This pass asks a cheaper question at a single, well-chosen
point and reports what can be said from it.

The point
---------
The slice screen (:mod:`Engine.Identifiability`) has already walked each
side with the nuisance parameters held at their fitted values, so the ladder
point where the *slice* first sits above the threshold is known, together
with the slice's value there. That point, not an interpolated crossing, is
where the nuisance minimization is run: its slice value is a measured number,
so how much of it the other parameters absorb is measured too, and nothing
rests on an interpolation whose bias would otherwise leak into every verdict.
The profile crossing lies at or beyond the slice crossing, because the slice
is an upper bound on the profile. At that one point a nuisance minimization
is run, in a few short rounds, and the amount by which dNLL falls says how
much the other parameters can compensate:

* It stays at the threshold: nothing compensates. The profile and the slice
  coincide here, the interval closes at the slice crossing, and the parameter
  is as well determined as the slice suggests.
* It falls to near zero: the whole displacement is absorbed at no cost in
  likelihood. There is a direction through parameter space along which the
  data say nothing over at least this range, and the profile crossing, if it
  exists at all, is far out.
* Somewhere in between: the interval is wider than the slice's by a factor
  that can be estimated, and it is likely, not certainly, closed.

What is proof and what is not
-----------------------------
Every evaluation of the nuisance objective is an upper bound on the profile.
So a value *below* the threshold is a proof that the profile there is below
the threshold too, and a small value is a proof that the profile is at least
that small. Those are the one-directional statements this pass can make with
certainty, and they all widen intervals.

A value that *stays high* proves nothing on its own: Nelder-Mead in fourteen
nuisance dimensions can sit far above the minimum for a long time. "Proven
true" below therefore rests on the optimizer reporting convergence, which is
the same standard the full profile applies when it declares a crossing, and
no stronger. A parameter whose descent stalled without converging is reported
as likely, never proven.

Widths are extrapolated under a locally quadratic profile: if the profile
sits at dNLL d at the slice crossing, a distance s from the optimum, its own
crossing is at least s * sqrt(threshold / d) out. Because d is an upper bound
the estimate is a lower bound on the width, not a guess at it.

Verdicts
--------
Each side of each parameter is judged on the statement "the 95% interval is
closed on this side":

    proven false   the screen proved the slice, and so the profile, still
                   below the threshold decades out. The side is open.
    unlikely true  dNLL at the slice crossing fell to within a small fraction
                   of zero. The nuisance set compensates almost fully; the
                   extrapolated crossing is several times further out and
                   usually beyond where the screen walked.
    likely true    dNLL fell but stayed clear of zero, or stayed above the
                   threshold without the optimizer converging.
    proven true    the nuisance minimization converged above the threshold at
                   the slice crossing: the interval closes at or inside it.
    no verdict     the side could not be screened, the point could not be
                   evaluated, or a better optimum than the fit was found.

Every point computed here is a legitimate profile record and is written to
the same checkpoint the full profile reads, so a full profile run afterwards
starts with these points in hand and nothing is spent twice.
