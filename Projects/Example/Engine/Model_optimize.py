    Two sources, and the spec wins. A run's diagnostics preset says what the

    spec's evaluations are, and the two specs sharing ``_PROFILE_ONLY`` differ
    by an order of magnitude in that cost. A spec states its own under
    ``optimizer_kwargs["profile_grid"]``, keyed by the engine's own argument
    names (``n_grid``, ``se_span``, ...). An unknown key is an error rather
    than a silent no-op: a typo there would otherwise look exactly like a
    setting that did not help.

    ``max_extend`` is the one to reach for when a CI comes back open. The
    opening grid is placed from the Wald SE (``se_span``) or, when the Hessian
    gave no SE, from ``range_factor``; whichever it is, it is a guess about
    where dNLL reaches 1.9207, and ``max_extend`` bounds how many times a side
    that guessed short may step further out before giving up. Raising
    ``se_span`` widens the opening guess for *every* parameter at once, which
    spends points on the ones already answered; raising ``max_extend`` spends
    them only where the answer is still missing.

    ``bracket_rtol`` is the opposite control: how precisely a crossing that has
    been bracketed needs to be located before probing stops. It is a relative
    precision on the confidence bound, so 0.05 means "to within 5%" -- far finer
    than identifiability needs, and the budget it releases goes to the sides
    that have not reached the threshold at all.

    and extends *margin* beyond them, measured as a fraction of each crossing's
    own distance from the optimum. That distance is multiplicative on a log
    axis, so the margin is too.

    Anchoring on the crossing rather than on the data is what keeps the figure
    readable. Two earlier rules both failed, in opposite directions. The
    original fixed window of [0.2, 3.5] was too narrow: it pre-dated the outward
    extension pass, so a crossing at a fifth of the optimum fell off the left
    edge. Spanning every computed point instead was too wide: a grid clipped to
    a parameter bound a thousand-fold below the optimum -- which is what the
    GantenerumabIV and Donanemab specs produce -- pushed the whole informative
    region, crossings included, into a sliver at the right-hand edge.

    A side with no crossing has no anchor, so it falls back to how far it was
    actually walked: that a profile ran three decades without reaching the
    threshold is the finding for that parameter, and cropping it would hide the
    one thing worth seeing. The window never extends past the computed data
    either, so it cannot imply points that were never evaluated.

    A log axis is used whenever every plotted ratio is positive, which is nearly
    always -- these are rate constants, volumes and clearances, and extension
    walks them over decades, which a linear axis cannot show at all.
